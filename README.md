This is based on a fork of chessmemory, by Daniel Borgmann:

Chessmemory is "a completely functional PGN viewer with an attractive interface". 

Chessmemory, on the other hand, is completely usable but only somewhat functional chess memorization software. Chessmemory's primary goal is to be a useful aid for studying and remembering opening lines. The method for achieving this is rote memorization, by loading PGN files that contain 1 line per game, preferably annotated.

After reviewing each line, three buttons can be clicked, which also are mapped to 3 keyboard shortcuts: Don't know (left shift), Fuzzy (spacebar), and Got it (enter). This will mark the particular game in the PGN file (which should map to a single line) accordingly. 

Install with "sudo python setup.py install".
